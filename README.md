## Tokens

### Tokens to run terraform

In order to run the terraform scripts you need to set `GITHUB_TOKEN` & `SONARCLOUD_TOKEN` as env vars locally.

To obtain your GitHub token go to:

* Profile &rarr; Developer Settings &rarr; [Personal access tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
* Use `export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token`

To obtain your SonarCloud token go to:

* Get token from SonarCloud [security](https://sonarcloud.io/account/security)
* Use `export SONARCLOUD_TOKEN=your_token`

Sonar token can expire in GitHub, if so replace `SONAR_TOKEN` in GitHub organization:

Organization &rarr; Settings &rarr; Security &rarr; Secrets and variables &rarr; [Actions](https://github.com/organizations/onecx-devops/settings/secrets/actions)
